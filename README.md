### My First Chatbot

The first chatbot created by me instructed on the course of Udemy Generative AI for Beginners. This is a chatbot where you put a document, the LLM will understand it and answer questions based on the document. It only accepts small to medium documents.

The LLM used is the Llama 3.3 70b instruct, a model made by Meta. And the Machine Learning platform used is WatsonX.AI by IBM.
